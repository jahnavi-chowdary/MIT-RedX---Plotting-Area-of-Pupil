# MIT-RedX---Plotting-Area-of-Pupil
Given a video file of the reaction/movement of the the right and left pupil to external  stimulus(light) along with the timestamps of both the videos , plot the area of the right pupil w.r.t  the left one at each instant of the given timestamps.

1. The main_file reads all the videos one by one from a folder containing all the Right eye videos data. (Assuming Right eye videos and Left eye videos are in 2 different folders). The .txt files of both the right and left eye are in the folder that contains the code and as a final step the plots are written into the current directory which is what we finally require. </br>
2. area_of_pupil plots the area of the pupil of both the right and left eye wrt their respective timestamps. </br>.
